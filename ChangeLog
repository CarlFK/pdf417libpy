Reviewed the code at https://sourceforge.net/projects/pdf417encode/
Seemes all of the funtionality for creating a barcode from text is in 
pdf417_enc.c  (There is some code to decode an image back into text 
in pdf417_dec, that can be dealt with later.)

Converted everything to autoconf/automake/libtool etc, with the intent to packge for debian.
